## Array List : 
An ArrayList is a class in Java that represents a resizable or dynamic array. It is part of the Java Collections Framework and provides an implementation of the List interface.
Unlike regular arrays in Java, which have a fixed length, an ArrayList can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed. This flexibility makes it a popular choice 
when you need to work with a collection of elements that may change in size frequently.

ArrayList provides a variety of methods to manipulate and access elements within the list. Here are some commonly used methods:

1. **add(element)**: Adds an element to the end of the ArrayList.
2. **add(index, element):** Inserts an element at the specified index in the ArrayList, shifting the existing elements to the right.
3. **get(index):** Retrieves the element at the specified index in the ArrayList.
4. **set(index, element):** Replaces the element at the specified index with a new element.
5. **remove(index):** Removes the element at the specified index from the ArrayList, shifting the subsequent elements to the left.
6. **remove(element):** Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from the ArrayList, if it exists.
7. **size():** Returns the number of elements in the ArrayList.
8. **isEmpty():** Checks if the ArrayList is empty.
9. **contains(element):** Checks if the ArrayList contains the specified element.
10. **indexOf(element):** Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in the ArrayList, or -1 if it is not found.
11. **lastIndexOf(element):** Returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in the ArrayList, or -1 if it is not found.
12. **clear():** Removes all elements from the ArrayList, leaving it empty.
13. **toArray():** Converts the ArrayList to an array.
