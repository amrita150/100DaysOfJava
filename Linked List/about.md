# Linked List 
**A linked list is a linear data structure used to store a collection of elements. It consists of nodes, 
where each node holds an element and a reference (or link) to the next node in the list. The last node in the 
list typically points to null to indicate the end of the list.**

The Linked list mainly has two nodes: the **Head** node and the **Tail** node.

- **Head:** The "head" is the first node of the linked list. It is the entry point to the list and contains the first element. 
The head node does not have any previous node pointing to it as it is the starting point of the list. To traverse the linked list,
you usually start from the head and follow the links to access other nodes.

- **Tail:** The "tail" is the last node of the linked list. It is the endpoint of the list and contains the last element.
  The tail node's "next" reference typically points to null, indicating the end of the list.
